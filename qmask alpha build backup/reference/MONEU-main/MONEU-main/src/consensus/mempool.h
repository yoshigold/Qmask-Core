// Transaction memory pool for a proof-of-work node.
//
// The pool holds fully validated pending transactions (the network and RPC
// admission paths run CheckTransaction + CheckTransactionWithUTXO +
// VerifyTransactionSignatures before calling AddTransaction) and hands them
// back for relay and block assembly. What the pool itself enforces is the
// resource policy, modeled on Bitcoin Core's CTxMemPool:
//
//   - The pool is limited in BYTES (sum of serialized transaction sizes,
//     noise proofs included), not in transaction count: bytes are the real
//     memory cost, and a count limit would let an attacker occupy far more
//     RAM with large transactions than intended.
//   - When the byte limit is exceeded, TrimLocked evicts the transactions
//     with the LOWEST fee rate first (fee per 1000 bytes), so under load
//     admission becomes a fee auction instead of first-come-first-served.
//     Flooding the pool with cheap transactions therefore cannot block it:
//     anyone paying more displaces the flood.
//   - Every eviction bumps a rolling minimum fee rate to the evicted rate
//     plus INCREMENTAL_FEE_PER_K, and new transactions below the rolling
//     rate are rejected outright - re-sending the evicted spam is not
//     enough to get back in. The rolling rate decays exponentially
//     (ROLLING_FEE_HALFLIFE, faster when the pool is emptier) once a block
//     has confirmed since the last bump, exactly like Bitcoin's
//     CTxMemPool::GetMinFee.
//   - Entries older than MEMPOOL_EXPIRY_SECONDS are expired lazily on each
//     admission, so transactions that will never confirm cannot occupy the
//     pool forever.
//   - An outpoint index rejects in-pool double spends: two pending
//     transactions can never spend the same output (UTXO validation alone
//     cannot see this, because neither spend is confirmed yet).
//   - A noise-leaf index rejects in-pool reuse of a single-use leaf: two
//     pending transactions can never consume the same (KPS, leafIndex),
//     even when they spend different outputs. Leaves are not bound to
//     outpoints, so the outpoint index cannot catch this; without it a
//     wallet replaying a stale leaf (or an attacker rebinding a captured
//     one) would put two conflicting transactions into the pool and the
//     miner would assemble a block its own network rejects.
//   - RemoveForBlock drops every transaction confirmed by a connected
//     block, plus any pending transaction that conflicts with one (spends
//     an outpoint the block spent, or consumes a noise leaf the block
//     consumed). Without this, mined transactions would re-enter the next
//     block template and the chain would reject it.
//
// Absolute fee floors (MIN_TX_FEE, dust) are consensus rules enforced in
// tx_validation before admission; the rolling rate here operates above
// that floor. Coinbase transactions never enter the pool.
//
// Block assembly order: GetTransactions returns highest fee rate first,
// so miners collect the most fees the pool can offer (Bitcoin's model),
// with admission order as the tie-breaker.
